# Pneumonia-Detection-from-chest-X-rays
Deep learning model that detects pneumonia from the Chest X-rays. The dataset used is Paul Mooney's chest x-ray pneumonia detection dataset, which is having a data imbalance issue. The dataset imbalance is solved and models like CNN and pre trained models like VGG19,ResNet50,EfficientNetb3 and DenseNet121 are used. Best model is EffiecientNetb3.
